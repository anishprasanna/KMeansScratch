Program clusters students code based on types of words used, and coding style using KMeans(from Scratch) and KMeans++. 

After running main, output will be shown in the Output.txt file.
    For the 2 cluster run - program cluster designations are listed.
    For the following cluster runs -# of clusters, # of programs within the cluster, and total SSE are shown for both Algorithms.
    
    
Plots presented in Kmeans.png, and KmeansPlus.png demonstrate comparison between the SSE of the two
Console output notes optimal number of clusters
Writen report details findings
